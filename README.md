# jpaserver-scripts (private)
scripts to start and config the hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter

This is a **private** repo so we don't have to sweat leaving passwords in here.

The reason for putting into git is so we can easily adapt this to laptop use.
I'm on macos, which doesn't have systemd. My focus there is on the scripts 
that systemd would call. I'm using a Postgres app for example.

Windows is another question.
